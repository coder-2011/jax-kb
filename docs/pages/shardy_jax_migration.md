# Shardy JAX Migration[\#](#shardy-jax-migration "Link to this heading")

## TL;DR[\#](#tl-dr "Link to this heading")

### What’s going on?[\#](#whats-going-on "Link to this heading")

[Shardy](https://openxla.org/shardy) is a new partitioning system co-developed by GDM Model Scaling (author of [PartIR](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11202)) and XLA/CoreML teams (author of [GSPMD](https://arxiv.org/abs//2105.04663)). Shardy aims to provide better usability and control to users, and will gradually replace GSPMD and PartIR.

After the migration is complete in March 2026, Shardy will be the only partitioner in JAX.

Until then, as a temporary workaround for any problems, Shardy [can be disabled](#how-can-i-disable-shardy-for-now). Please file a [JAX issue](https://github.com/jax-ml/jax/issues) if you encounter any problem.

### How do I know if Shardy broke my code?[\#](#how-do-i-know-if-shardy-broke-my-code "Link to this heading")

The easiest way to tell if Shardy is responsible for any problems is to disable Shardy and see if the issues go away. See [What issues can arise when Shardy is switched on?](#what-issues-can-arise-when-shardy-is-switched-on) section below.

You can tell that Shardy is enabled by looking for `Using`` ``Shardy`` ``for`` ``XLA`` ``SPMD`` ``propagation`` ``in`` ``the`` ``logs`.

### How can I disable Shardy for now?[\#](#how-can-i-disable-shardy-for-now "Link to this heading")

Until March, 2026 it will be possible to temporarily disable Shardy by:

- setting the shell environment variable `JAX_USE_SHARDY_PARTITIONER` to something false-like (e.g., 0);

- setting the boolean flag `jax_use_shardy_partitioner` to something false-like if your code parses flags with absl;

- using this statement in your main file or anywhere before you call `jax.jit`:

      import jax
      jax.config.update('jax_use_shardy_partitioner', False)

To debug partitioning with Shardy enabled, you can enable MLIR dumps as follows:

    --xla_dump_hlo_pass_re=shardy --xla_dump_to=<some_directory>

NOTE: Please disable only the specific use cases that are not working as expected if possible, and file a [bug](https://github.com/jax-ml/jax/issues) with a reproducer, so we can resolve it asap and re-enable Shardy.

### JAX export backwards compatibility[\#](#jax-export-backwards-compatibility "Link to this heading")

Enabling Shardy in JAX by default is maintaining the 6 months backwards compatibility guarantee. This means that you will be able to load a model exported with Shardy disabled for at least 6 months after Shardy becomes enabled for your model. That old checkpointed model will run with GSPMD, and only when re-exporting the model will it start running with Shardy.

However, if you still encounter an issue with loading an old checkpoint, please contact us or file a [bug](https://github.com/jax-ml/jax/issues).

NOTE: exporting a model with Shardy enabled, then loading it with Shardy disabled isn’t supported and will fail.

### How do I prepare for Shardy being enabled in March 2026 permanently?[\#](#how-do-i-prepare-for-shardy-being-enabled-in-march-2026-permanently "Link to this heading")

Due to us falling back to GSPMD for any JAX export checkpoint for 6 months, to help find any potential issues, please re-export any models you have with Shardy enabled. Then you can see if it runs fine, or there is any bug we need to fix.

## What issues can arise when Shardy is switched on?[\#](#what-issues-can-arise-when-shardy-is-switched-on "Link to this heading")

### Performance regression or OOM[\#](#performance-regression-or-oom "Link to this heading")

While Shardy improves on the existing sharding propagation systems (GSPMD and PartIR), it can sometimes output slightly different results due to different propagation order or conflict resolution heuristics.

This doesn’t necessarily mean that Shardy is doing the wrong thing, but possibly that there aren’t enough sharding constraints in the program, so a small change in propagation order can affect the final result. It can also hint that existing sharding constraints were overfitted to GSPMD and require slight adjustments with Shardy.

Therefore, it is possible that enabling Shardy will cause some models to have a performance regression or OOM (especially if the model was already close to the memory capacity). However, we have already migrated many use cases across Alphabet, and have observed equivalent or better performance than GSPMD.

To resolve such issues, users can either:

1.  Disable Shardy temporarily and open a [bug](https://github.com/jax-ml/jax/issues) with a reproducer.

2.  Add additional sharding constraints to make sure Shardy does the desired thing.

### Compilation failure[\#](#compilation-failure "Link to this heading")

We have done extensive testing across many JAX models. However, it’s possible that there are certain edge cases or situations we don’t support/handle (because we didn’t know we needed to).

This means that although rare, it’s possible that you will get a compilation failure in the form of a segfault, hard check, python value error, etc.

In such a case, please disable Shardy temporarily and open a [bug](https://github.com/jax-ml/jax/issues) with a reproducer.

### Inconsistent value of the use Shardy flag[\#](#inconsistent-value-of-the-use-shardy-flag "Link to this heading")

If Shardy is disabled somewhere in your code, but there are still paths that use the default value of the JAX flag, this can cause issues. For example, exporting a model with Shardy enabled, then loading it with Shardy disabled isn’t supported and will fail (the other way is supported for [backwards compatibility](#jax-export-backwards-compatibility)).

The symptom for an issue like this can be an error in JAX or in XLA/Shardy, or just undefined behavior. You can try disabling Shardy globally in [JAX config](https://github.com/jax-ml/jax/blob/main/jax/_src/config.py) to see if the issue goes away.

NOTE: Please ensure that Shardy is disabled consistently if needed, or remove any explicit modification of the flag, to have the default value apply throughout.

### New way to use the JAX `jax.experimental.custom_partitioning` API[\#](#new-way-to-use-the-jax-jax-experimental-custom-partitioning-api "Link to this heading")

If you use this API, you may see the error

    Shardy is used, but sharding propagation callbacks instead of sharding_rule are
    provided. Need to provide sharding_rule to migrate to Shardy.

Instead of defining `infer_sharding_from_operands` and `propagate_user_sharding` callbacks, define a `jax.experimental.SdyShardingRule` that specifies an einsum-like relationship between dimensions during propagation. Refer to the [`custom_partitioning` doc](https://docs.jax.dev/en/latest/jax.experimental.custom_partitioning.html#module-jax.experimental.custom_partitioning) for more info on how to define a sharding rule.

### `jax.export` requires all inputs and outputs to have the same mesh[\#](#jax-export-requires-all-inputs-and-outputs-to-have-the-same-mesh "Link to this heading")

As part of the Shardy migration, `jax.export` now requires all input/output shardings to live on the same mesh - same axis names and sizes.
